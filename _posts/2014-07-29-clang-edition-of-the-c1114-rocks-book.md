Do you use Clang to compile C++? Would you like to know all about the C++11 and C++14 language features it supports?

You can read about them in the new edition of my C++11/14 Rocks book tailored to Clang. I carefully collected everything you need  into one short, clear book.

Clang already supports all of these C++14 features as of version 3.4:

*   Return type deduction for regular functions
*   Generic lambdas
*   Initialized lambda captures
*   Variable templates
*   Relaxed requirements on _constexpr_ functions
*   Refined member initialization in aggregates
*   Binary literals
*   _deprecated_ attribute
*   Single quotation mark as digit separator

A couple of notes:

*   For those who have the GCC edition of the book: you'll already be familiar with all the C++11 content as GCC also has full C++11 support. However, the Clang edition has full C++14 coverage instead of an overview.
*   The book doesn't cover library features.
