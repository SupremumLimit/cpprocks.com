I thought about creating a cheatsheet for the C++11 regex library for a long time, and I finally sat down and made it over the last few days. In case you haven't encountered them, regular expressions are a powerful way of searching and manipulating strings.

Because I wanted to limit the cheatsheet to one page, I couldn't include all the information about the library. I had to omit some things like types in function signatures, but they should be easy to deduce. The cheatsheet only shows the ECMAScript variant of the syntax (which is the default). I think it has enough information to be a useful aide-m√©moire.
